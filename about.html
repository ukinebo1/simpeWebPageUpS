    <h1>Precious Bamawo</h1>
    <p>I am a student at upskills who is currently at the beginner stage of coding.</p>
    <p>This is my experience with HTML using it to create a simple webpage. 
        Although it is my first experience but I know I will become a world class developer.</p>
    <p>Thank you upskill for all you are doing.</p>
    <p>Thing I like doing include:
        <li>Reading Rhapsody of Realities</li>
        <li>Exploring the world through science fiction movies</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com"> Coding</a> through Upskill bootcamp.</li>
